        <p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1tbs Butter</li>
            <li>2tbs Cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt Butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
            <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
            <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
            <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan
                to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)</li>
            <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
